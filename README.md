helping you spot impersonation tricks at a glance.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Detects and replaces a wide range of hidden characters, including:
  - Zero-width spaces (`\u200B`, `\u200C`, `\u200D`, `\uFEFF`)
  - Control characters like BiDi marks (`\u200E`, `\u200F`, `\u202Aâ€“\u202E`, `\u2066â€“\u2069`)
  - Non-breaking space (`\u00A0`)
  - Tab (`\u0009`)
- Shows a selectable emoji marker instead, so invisible text becomes noticeable
- Provides a draggable control panel with position persistence
- Allows choosing the replacement emoji from preset options
- Offers a highlight toggle with preset color options
- Applies a monospace-based font style to alliance tags, making homoglyph-based impersonation easier to spot

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This script is made specifically for [wplace.live](https://wplace.live/) to prevent impersonation.
Some users insert zero-width, confusing, or lookalike characters into alliance tags to mimic others.
By making these characters visible and applying a consistent font style, such tricks become immediately noticeable.
The script focuses only on alliance tags, so normal text elsewhere on the page is unaffected.
