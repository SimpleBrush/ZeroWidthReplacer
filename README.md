## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This script is made specifically for [wplace.live](https://wplace.live/) to prevent impersonation.  
Some users insert zero-width or confusing characters into alliance tags to mimic others.  
By making these characters visible, such tricks become immediately noticeable.  
The script focuses only on alliance tags, so normal text elsewhere on the page is unaffected.
