# Zero Width Replacer

Tampermonkey userscript that replaces invisible and zero-width characters (ZWSP, ZWNJ, ZWJ, BOM, BiDi controls, etc.) with a visible, selectable emoji.  

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Detects and replaces a wide range of hidden characters, including zero-width spaces (`\u200B`, `\u200C`, `\u200D`, `\uFEFF`) and BiDi control characters (`\u200E`, `\u200F`, `\u202Aâ€“\u202E`, `\u2066â€“\u2069`)
- Shows a selectable emoji marker instead, so invisible text becomes noticeable
- Provides a draggable control panel with position persistence
- Allows choosing the replacement emoji from predefined options

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This script is made specifically for [wplace.live](https://wplace.live/) to prevent impersonation.  
Some users insert zero-width characters into nicknames or alliances to mimic others.  
By making these characters visible, such tricks become immediately noticeable.
