# Zero Width Replacer

Tampermonkey userscript that replaces zero-width characters (ZWSP, ZWNJ, ZWJ, BOM) with a visible emoji ðŸš¨.  

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Detects and replaces hidden characters (`\u200B`, `\u200C`, `\u200D`, `\uFEFF`)
- Shows ðŸš¨ emoji instead, so invisible text becomes noticeable
- Runs automatically and in real time

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This script is made specifically for [wplace.live](https://wplace.live/) to prevent impersonation.  
Some users insert zero-width characters into nicknames or alliances to mimic others.  
By making these characters visible, such tricks become immediately noticeable.
